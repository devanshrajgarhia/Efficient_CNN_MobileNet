Guidlines:

Create Working Directories for each person. Remember to pull before you push. Alsp remember to commit to your local branch before you pull else you could lose all preogress. Else all the collective code could be potentially wiped out. I would recommend creating branches and working on them. Also, work and commit to your own branches and do not touch the main. 

Work only in your own folder, it is a temporary place for you to work. Later everything shall be shifted to final_library with integration.
